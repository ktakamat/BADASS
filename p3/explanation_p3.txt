Project: BADASS Part 3 - BGP EVPN with VXLAN
Login: ktakamat

[Overview]
This project implements a modern Data Center network architecture using BGP EVPN (RFC 7432) and VXLAN.
It simulates a Spine-Leaf topology where routers automatically exchange host information (MAC addresses) using BGP, allowing hosts to communicate over a VXLAN overlay.

[Topology]
- Architecture: Spine-Leaf (1 Spine, 3 Leafs)
- Spine: router-ktakamat-1 (Route Reflector)
- Leafs: router-ktakamat-2, 3, 4 (VTEPs)
- Hosts: host-ktakamat-1, 2, 3 (All in 20.1.1.0/24 subnet)

[Technologies Used]
- Underlay: OSPF (for IP reachability between Loopback interfaces)
- Overlay Control Plane: iBGP with EVPN address family
- Overlay Data Plane: VXLAN (VNI 10)
- BGP Role: Route Reflector (RR) on Spine to simplify peering

[Configuration Method]
Configuration is fully automated using shell scripts.
- The `exec_confs.sh` script detects running containers and injects the corresponding configuration script.
- MTU is adjusted to 1450 on VXLAN interfaces to prevent packet drops due to encapsulation overhead.

[Files Description]
- badass_part3.gns3project: The GNS3 project file.
- exec_confs.sh: Automation script.
- router-ktakamat-1: Config for Spine (BGP RR, Dynamic Neighbor, OSPF).
- router-ktakamat-2/3/4: Config for Leafs (VXLAN setup, BGP Client, Advertise all VNI).
- host-ktakamat-1/2/3: Config for Hosts.
- Dockerfile.*: Docker build files (Same as Part 1/2).

[How to Run]
1. Open the .gns3project file in GNS3.
2. Start all nodes.
3. Open a terminal in this folder.
4. Run the configuration script:
   $ chmod +x exec_confs.sh
   $ ./exec_confs.sh
5. Verify BGP session (Optional):
   (On router-1 console)
   # vtysh -c "show bgp l2vpn evpn summary"
6. Verify Connectivity:
   (On host-1 console)
   # ping 20.1.1.2
